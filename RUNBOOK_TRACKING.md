# Colab runbooks — tracking

Shared **`progress.csv`** fields: `tag`, `status`, `last_step`, `total_steps`, `last_loss`, `step_avg_ms`, `ckpt_bytes`, `notes`. Feasibility = jobs finish **`OK`**, **steps match** the tag, **loss does not worsen** extending seed-42 runs (100→200→300), **same `ckpt_bytes`** across OK rows, plus the notebook’s **summary gate** and **mini val** when present.

**Experiment** links = GitHub **repo / branch** the runbook targets. `.ipynb` files may live in [`parameter-golf`](https://github.com/jmoncayo-pursuit/parameter-golf) or **this repo** (Gimlet). Branches: [parameter-golf-qat-int4/branches](https://github.com/jmoncayo-pursuit/parameter-golf-qat-int4/branches).

**How to read the table**

| Column | Meaning |
|:---|:---|
| **Colab done** | Finished a Colab pass on the current notebook revision? (**✓** = yes) |
| **Jobs pass** | Count of `progress.csv` rows with `status=OK` vs planned jobs (**7/7** = every slot succeeded). *Use the fraction here, not ✓.* |
| **Stage A** | Stage A tags: steps match (`last_step` = `total_steps`), and seed-42 loss does not worsen 100→200→300. |
| **Ckpt stable** | Same checkpoint byte size on every OK run. *Table: ✓ (**`ckpt_bytes` B × OK rows**) when recorded.* |
| **Summary strong** | Notebook aggregate “strong signal” (Gimlet cell 5 = `BASELINE_CHECKPOINT_SIGNAL_STRONG`). |
| **Mini bpb** | Mini val bits/byte when run (**—** if skipped). |
| **Runpod** | **✓** = OK to spend credits after Colab; else short reason (e.g. `No — Colab first`). |

**Values:** **✓** = pass / yes · **—** = not run · Plain text = blocked (e.g. `No — Colab first`).
